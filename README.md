## About this project

This project was made for a thesis, and aims to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the React.js library.
It is a simulation of a smart parking system that keeps track of the license plate and time of arrival of each vehicle that has parked inside it.

When running the project, the user is greeted by a menu where they may either connect to a server (which simulates the vehicle entering the parking area) or host a server (which simulates the smart parking system).

Along with React.js, this project also uses Node.js for managing the HTTP server and websockets.

Keep in mind that this project, as it is only a prototype, does have bugs/security issues which may arise when not using the project as intended.

## Installation

After setting up a local copy of the project, install the dependencies using the command:
### npm install
